/**
 * What "only the host controls the music" means on this side of the wire.
 *
 * The enforcement itself is the server's — see `cloudflare-jam/src/party.js control authorization` — so
 * what is worth pinning down here is the derivation every player surface reads,
 * and the two compatibility cases that decide whether a party is locked or not
 * when the answer is missing.
