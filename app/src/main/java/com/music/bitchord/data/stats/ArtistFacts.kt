/**
 * What the Replay knows about an artist beyond their name: their picture, their
 * page, and what kind of music they make.
 *
 * ## Why any of this needs looking up
 *
 * Listening is counted per *name*, because a name is the only thing every track
 * carries — see [ListeningStats]. That is enough to rank artists and nothing
 * else. Three things the artist chart wants are simply not in the listening:
 *
 *  - **A picture of the artist.** Every track carries its own sleeve, and using
 *    that gave an artist chart illustrated with album covers — the same cover as
 *    the song chart above it, which reads as the page having drawn the wrong
 *    list rather than as a deliberate choice.
 *  - **A page to open.** A browse id only rides along when the row that queued
 *    the track happened to have one, which for a home-feed card or an AutoPlay
 *    suggestion it does not.
 *  - **A genre.** Nothing this app already talks to states one. YouTube Music's
 *    browse responses carry none — an album page bills itself "Album • 2023" —
 *    and the source modules hand back audio, not taxonomy.
 *
 * ## One store, two sources, two gates
 *
 * The picture and the page come from a YouTube Music artist search, which this
 * app is already talking to constantly and which is therefore not worth a
 * setting. The genre comes from Last.fm's `artist.getTopTags`, which is a
 * different service and *is* a setting ([AppSettings.replayGenres]): it sends an
 * artist's name and nothing else — no track, no time, no id, no indication that
 * anything was played — and turned off, the genre chart simply isn't drawn while
 * every other chart is unaffected.
 *
 * Both are asked once per artist and kept on this device for good, so the cost
 * is a couple of requests the first time somebody new turns up.
 *
 * ## Why the tags are filtered rather than used
 *
 * Last.fm tags are folksonomy, not taxonomy: alongside "shoegaze" sit "seen
 * live", "favourites", "albums i own" and several thousand more that describe
 * the tagger rather than the music. Taking the top tag verbatim produces a chart
 * whose leading genre is "awesome". So a tag only counts if it matches
 * [VOCABULARY] — a fixed list of things that are actually genres — and an artist
 * with no matching tag contributes nothing rather than a wrong answer.
