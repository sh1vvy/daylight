 * The kinds of source this build knows how to talk to.

 * `SourceRegistry.active()`, which sorts on it — so the sources a user added
 * come first, then the legacy built-in module kind, then JioSaavn, then
 * YouTube Music. Adding a source means adding a [MusicSource]
 * implementation and an entry here, which is the point — every protocol the
 * app speaks is one someone can read in this repo, and a source can't teach
 * the app a new way to behave after it ships.
 *
 * What varies per *instance* — which index, whose module — is [SourceConfig].

     * Measured on this device, the gap is not close: JioSaavn answers a search
     * and hands back a stream URL in about 0.4s, while a module index takes
     * 7-13s to walk its backends — and read-ahead runs on the track *after* the
     * one playing, so a lookup that slow is usually still going when the
     * listener arrives. A wasted JioSaavn resolve costs one HTTP round trip; a
     * wasted module resolve costs a QuickJS engine, an index fetch and several
     * backend searches. The first is worth spending speculatively and the
     * second is not.
     *
     * False for [YOUTUBE] as well, though it *is* warmed ahead of time — that
     * happens through its own read-ahead in
     * [AudioCache][com.music.bitchord.playback.AudioCache], which speaks video
     * ids directly and needs no cross-source match to find the track.
