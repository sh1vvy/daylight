/**
 * Publishes what's playing to Discord as a Rich Presence activity.
 *
 * This talks to Discord as a *user*, over the same gateway its own client
 * uses — there is no official API for a third-party app to set a user's
 * presence, so the token in [token] is the account's own bearer token and the
 * socket identifies itself as Discord Android (see [SuperProperties]). That is
 * the only way this feature can exist, and it is why the settings screen warns
 * about it before asking for a login.
 *
 * The presence Discord renders from one [updateSong] call:
 *
 * ```
 *   Listening to Daylight          <- activityName, or the app's own name
 *   ┌────┐  Song title             <- details
 *   │art │  Artist                 <- state
 *   └────┘  Hi-Res Lossless · FLAC · 4608 kbps · 24-bit · 96 kHz
 *           ▁▁▁▁▁▁ 1:04 / 3:47     <- from the timestamps
 *   [ Listen on YouTube Music ]    <- button 1
 *   [ Visit Daylight           ]   <- button 2
 * ```

     * presence set once stays correct for the rest of the track, and the only
     * reason to send another is that something about the track *changed* —
     * which is also why [playbackSpeed] has to be divided out of both: at 1.5x
     * the wall-clock time left is not the media time left, and a presence that
     * ignored it would finish its countdown while the song was still playing.
