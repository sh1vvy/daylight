/**
 * The whole of what this app knows about you, as one JSON file you own.
 *
 * Two errands, and they are the same errand: moving to a new phone, and being
 * able to see what is being kept. Everything Replay counts lives only on this
 * device, which is the point of it — and the flip side of that is that a factory
 * reset takes it with no way back, so there has to be a way out.
 *
 * ## What is in it
 *
 * Every preference except credentials (see [AppSettings.exportPrefs]), and every
 * month of listening. Not the audio cache, the downloads or the artwork: those
 * are megabytes that re-fetch themselves, and a backup that is mostly cache is
 * one nobody keeps.
 *
 * ## Typed values rather than a JSON object
 *
 * Preferences come off Android as `Map<String, Any?>` and go back the same way,
 * where the *type* decides which `put` is called. Written as plain JSON, `0.5`
 * comes back a Double and lands in a Float preference as a class-cast crash the
 * first time it is read — weeks later, in a settings screen, with nothing
 * pointing at the import. So each value carries its type and is parsed back into
 * exactly the type it left as, and anything unrecognised is skipped rather than
 * guessed at.
